# Further Work

The answer above demonstrates what is possible with the technology of the present. However, we won't stop there. The following could be the course of action: (unsorted).

## IBC Queries

We'll closely follow the development of IBC queries, which is a technology we assume to allow for faster round trips and lower fees.

## Alternative Entropy Sources

We adore the first decentralised entropy source that Drand and the League of Entropy delivered to the internet. Choice, though, is crucial. In order to obtain faster and less expensive randomization, certain applications might be willing to give up some of the security features. Some users might demand that district [MPC] participants vote on governance. Although the possibilities will be investigated, the network will be built for numerous sources.
 


## Internalizing randomness generation

The node operators of the Noir Network could integrate randomness generation into their own operations. There has been work to [integrate random beacons into Tendermint](https://medium.com/@dgaminghub/arcade-tendermint-hack-with-built-in-threshold-bls-random-beacon-for-applications-a51eafb77f53) that could be explored. But also a second process that runs along with the validator node would be an option.

## More features

The drand randomness is the foundation for the timed encryption feature that drand is providing. It would make sense to incorporate it with the Noir Network and provide the first timed encryption function on the Ethereum ecosystem.
