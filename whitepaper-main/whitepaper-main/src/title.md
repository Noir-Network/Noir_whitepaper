# Nois Network

Noir Network aims to bring randomness  to the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a safe and secure entropy source and distributing randomness in the form of random beacons.



More precisely, Noir provides **public randomness**, i.e. values that are unpredictable for all participants of the system but free to share once published. Private randomness that needs to be kept secret is out of scope for this whitepaper.
